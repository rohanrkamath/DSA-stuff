## Basic Definitions

- Root node - Top node
- Child node - Nodes to the bottom of a particular parent node
- Leave node - End nodes, with no children
- Ancestors - All the parents from a particular node
- Level - Layers of teh tree -> Root node is Level 1

## Tree types 

- Complete Tree - All nodes have children except the last ones, and all the nodes of the last level are to the left as possible.
- Full Binary Tree - All nodes have children(either 0 or 2 children), even the last layer.

## Types of traversals

- BFS
- DFS
    - Preorder (root->left->right)
    - Inorder (left->root->right)
    - Postorder (left->right>root)
